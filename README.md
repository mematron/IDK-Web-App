# IDK-Web-App
A helpful web app for Apple Retail (Apple, Inc.)

This is an asynchronous web application I wrote for Apple Retail in 2007.
It was made to provide a quick reference for Specialists to common
questions in a retail environment. It ran on an iPhone with a native look 
and responsiveness.  Although this iteration was not deployed on
a large scale, itâ€™s base code, UI/UX design was the foundation for the
Smart Sign, an iOS app that showed product specs on iPads inside Apple Stores.

Download this entire repo and open the "index.html" file inside 
the project folder in a browser.  This will run on most desktop browsers.  However, 
it was designed to be viewed on 2nd iPhone. That means that it will look best on 
and iPhone or iPod Touch.
