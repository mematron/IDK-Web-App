# IDK-Web-App
A web app made for Apple Retail

This is a custom web application made at and for Apple Retail in 2008.
It was made to provide a quick reference for Specialists to common
questions on the sales floor.  It was made to run on an iPhone with a
native look and at speeds.  Although this iteration was not deployed on
a large scale, itâ€™s base code, UI/UX design was the foundation for the
Smart Signs that everyone uses to answer common questions about Apple
goods and services.

To experience it just open the "index.html" file.  This will run on most 
desktop browsers.  However, it was designed to to viewed on 2nd iPhone.
That means that it will not be as crispy on a Retina Display - remember, 
those weren't around in 2007.  

Although the data set is now static it is asynchronous.  In 2007 that was a big deal.
Today, not so much.
